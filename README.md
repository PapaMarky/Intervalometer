This file is a work in progress. It captures ideas that I have now, but will no doubt change as we 
iterate on the implementation and make new discoveries about the capabilities of ccapi, etc.

# Canon Camera Controller - Portable Off-Grid System
## Background
This project creates a portable, off-grid camera control system for remote photography in areas without internet or LAN access.

**Use Case**: Night sky photography in remote dark-sky locations where:
- No internet or cellular connectivity available
- Need comprehensive camera control for long-exposure timelapse photography
- Require portable, battery-powered solution
- Want professional camera control via mobile device

**Technical Foundation**: Canon's CCAPI (Camera Control API) enables full remote control via RESTful API:
- Complete camera settings control (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, etc.)
- Live view streaming and remote focusing
- Advanced shooting modes and intervalometer functionality
- Real-time camera status and battery monitoring

## Goal

**Portable Architecture**: 
- Raspberry Pi creates isolated WiFi network (no internet required)
- Canon camera connects to Pi's WiFi access point
- User devices (iPhone/MacBook) connect to same Pi WiFi network
- Pi serves comprehensive camera control web application
- Entire system operates on battery power for field deployment

**Target Deployment**: Remote locations for astrophotography and nature photography where traditional connectivity is unavailable.

## MVP Definition - Off-Grid Camera Control System

**Hardware Setup**:
* Raspberry Pi functions as WiFi access point (no external internet required)
* Canon EOS R50 connects to Pi's WiFi network
* Battery power for extended field operation

**Network Auto-Discovery**:
* Pi automatically detects camera connections via CCAPI detection sequence:
  1. Probe: `https://device-ip:443/ccapi` (detect camera capability)
  2. Connect: `https://device-ip:443/ccapi/connect` (establish CCAPI session)
* User devices (iPhone 11 primary target) join Pi's WiFi network
* Automatic redirection to camera control web app for non-camera devices

**Web Application**:
* Responsive design for mobile-first operation (iPhone 11 optimized)
* Complete camera control interface with real-time status
* Offline operation - all assets served locally from Pi
* Persistent settings and session recovery across power cycles

**Deployment**:
* Debian package for automated Pi setup and configuration
* Systemd services for access point, camera server, and web application
* Single-command installation and updates

### Field-Ready Camera Interface
* MCP server handles all CCAPI communication with fault tolerance
* Automatic reconnection after camera power cycles
* Graceful handling of RF interference and connection drops
* Power-aware operations to extend battery life

## Dual-Mode Network Configuration

**Development Mode**: Pi connects to home WiFi while serving camera access point
- Internet access for updates and development
- Camera remains connected via dedicated AP interface
- Simplified testing and debugging

**Field Mode**: Access point only for battery-optimized operation
- No external network dependencies
- Maximum battery life for extended field sessions
- Isolated network for camera and user devices

**Technical Implementation**: Manual configuration using standard Debian packages (hostapd, dnsmasq) - no third-party installers required. See [Network Configuration Documentation](docs/network-configuration.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Field Photography Features**

_Intervalometer (Optimized for Night Sky)_
* **Scheduling**: Start/end times with astronomical twilight integration
* **Exposure Planning**: Automatic validation of interval vs shutter speed
* **Power Management**: Battery-aware session planning
* **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time capture status and remaining shots

_Additional Controls_
* **Manual Mode Optimization**: Quick access to common night photography settings
* **Focus Assistance**: Live view with magnification for manual focus
* **Environmental Monitoring**: Track session duration and conditions
* **Emergency Controls**: Safe camera shutdown and session recovery
## Delivery: Debian Package
