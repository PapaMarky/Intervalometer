# Assets directory for PWA icons and images
# 
# This directory should contain:
# - icon-72.png through icon-512.png (PWA app icons)
# - screenshot-mobile.png (375x812 mobile screenshot)
# - screenshot-tablet.png (768x1024 tablet screenshot)
#
# Icons can be generated from a single 512x512 source image using:
# - https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
#
# For now, the app will work without these icons but they improve
# the PWA installation experience.
